A minimal vocabulary trainer based on active recall.

This is a minimalist vocabulary learning tool inspired by the principles of active recall and honest self-assessment. Rather than recognizing answers from a list, learners are asked to retrieve the translation from memory. After seeing the correct answer, they decide whether they truly knew it or not. The program avoids distractions, gamification, and scoring systems, focusing entirely on the learning moment itself.
